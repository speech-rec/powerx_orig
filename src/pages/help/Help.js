            Go to your Note Recording screen and press the Recording button to
            start dictation. (The system will show activity as it processes your
            speech and will replace the estimated text with the actual dictated

             Pressing the Cancel button will reset the editor for a new

            note that will be stored in the cloud in your portal.

            NOTE:
            <br/>
             Please note that this app by default
            is HIPAA compliant and saves the dictated text to the cloud in a
            secure manner. Use the email option only if you are not sharing any
            secure text or confidential information.

            Editing your dictated file in the portal
          </h2>

          <p>
            Once you have finished dictating your file, it will be stored in the
            cloud portal. Login to your portal account, select the note from the
            list and edit it in the online editor for any final changes.
          </p>
          <h2 className="headingColor">Printing</h2>
          <p>
            The system not only allows you to print your files at any time, it
            gives to the flexibility to customize the format of the page on
            which the text will be printed. You can upload your custom header
            and footer, and these will be printed for any note that you select
            and print.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
             You can even create a separate account for someone on
            your team to access your portal securely and print out the
            transcribed documents while you concentrate on dictating your notes.
            This workflow will help you quickly dictate separate notes while
            another person exclusively reviews them and prints them out as they
            get completed.

                  The software have a built-in word repository to fine tune the

                  pauses that we use when speaking normally. When this feature
                  is not enabled, the user needs to speak out the punctuation
                  like comma and period to be typed out.

                <strong style={{color: "black"}}>Enabling</strong> this option will let the system determine where to put in standard punctuations as you speak.
                 When you lightly pause the system will place a ‘comma’ punctuation.
                  When you pause for a bit longer during your speech, the system will place a ‘period’ there.

                  text will appear in the editor. The user needs to say
                  “Dictaphone” before the name of the template. For example, if
